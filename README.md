# Segmentation Customer with Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) Analysis

## Overview

This repository focuses on customer segmentation using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis. The RFM model is a marketing analytics tool that segments customers based on their transaction behaviors. This analysis helps businesses tailor their marketing strategies for different customer segments, optimizing engagement and maximizing revenue.

- Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase.
- Monetary: The monetary value of a customer's purchases.

The RFM scores are calculated, and customers are segmented accordingly.
